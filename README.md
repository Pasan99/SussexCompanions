# SussexCompanions

Sussex Companions (SC) is a club for the over 50s, which seeks to match up individuals with new friends. The company is based in Brighton - a charming city by the sea on the South Coast of England. Many people move to Brighton and other places on the South Coast after retirement and seek to find new friends with similar hobbies and interests. SC has lots of customers and is thriving as a business. 

The company is fairly traditional – the staff meet new clients in person to get to know them and identify potential matches by hand rather than with an automated system. In addition to matching individuals up with new friends, they also host several events each year, to which all clients are invited. These range from evenings lectures to coastal walks and yacht trips – even skydiving and rock-climbing trips have been arranged for the more adventurous clients. The success of SC in helping to create new friendships means that a good deal of business comes from personal recommendations. All clients pay a membership fee.

Having developed largely through word-of-mouth, they have grown very rapidly over the past decade and have recently opened up new offices in the nearby towns of Eastbourne and Bognor Regis, which are also attracting a large number of clients. 

The huge increase in client numbers makes it harder to make suitable matches by hand and to retain the personal touch of getting to know clients - this is very time-consuming. The current systems for storing clients’ details and billing clients are also inefficient and not robust enough to handle the current number of clients: currently client files are stored using MS Word and event bookings are taken over the phone and stored in a spreadsheet. Several clients have complained about being billed after they have cancelled their membership, and some clients have managed to avoid being billed for attending events, which are expensive to organize and are billed separately to the monthly membership fee.

The CEO of SC is looking to modernize the business to enable further expansion, both in terms of new offices and online. They are looking for a better means of storing client details and payment records, invoicing and handling event bookings, and are also looking for some method of automating the matching process. There are also plans to enable clients to sign up online, provide an online forum, and expand the business to allow for another set of online-only clients from further afield. 


Business Solutions (BS) is a software development consultancy based in the center of Brighton, around 10 minutes’ walk from SC’s main office. Business Solutions have purpose built rooms for Facilitated Workshops and Agile software development projects. SC has decided to contract Business Solutions, on a ‘time and materials’ basis for the development of their new computer system using an Agile development approach.

The new computerized system for Sussex Companions will replace the old ad-hoc system of Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, and is likely to include some of the following functionality:
 
 

•	Receive contact details of new clients via telephone, fax, post or email – carried out by Receptionist (M)

•	Receive contact details of new clients via web form (M)

•	Receive details of client’s hobbies and personality in person – carried out by  Client Service Agents (M)

•	Receive details of client’s hobbies and personality via web form Search for keywords in profiles to speed up matches – carried out by Client Service Agents (M)

•	Automated friendship matching tool to match clients with no input from Client Service Agents

•	Capture the appropriate details of new clients and store details of existing clients – carried out by Receptionist or Client Service Agent (M) 

•	Generate an events schedule, indicating when events (and what type of event) are available – carried out by Senior Client Service Agent (M) 

•	Accept bookings for events via telephone, fax, post or email – carried out by Receptionist (M)

•	Accept bookings for events via web form Create a daily report of which meetings have been scheduled between which clients – carried out by the Client Service Agent (M)

•	Create a monthly report of successful matches – carried out by the Senior Client Service Agent (M)

•	Calculate membership fees for clients, to be billed monthly. Fees are charged at £12 per month for Local Clients, and £5 per month for remote online clients – carried out by Finance Manager (M) 

•	Calculate Event fees for clients. Event charges vary depending on the nature of the event – carried out by Finance Manager (M)

•	Accept credit card payment from clients. Must be confirmed by the credit card company Create payment overdue demand letters if a client is more than 30 days late in paying their monthly bill – carried out by the Finance Manager (M)

•	Schedule reviews for unsuccessfully matched clients on a 3-monthly basis – carried out by the Receptionist (M)

•	Create quarterly reports of events held and income generated for each event – carried out by Finance Manager (M)

The new system should be able to print schedules, invoices, bookings and overdue payment demands at a rate of 1 every 3 seconds. However, an upper limit of 10 seconds would be acceptable. 

The Managing Director (Ms Amelia Lake) has stated that the new system should be deployed in no later than 5 months. The functionality that must be delivered has been marked with an ‘(M)’ in the above list.
